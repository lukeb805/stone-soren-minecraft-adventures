        story: `Soren was walking through the plains biome.
He had his shiny iron sword ready.
Then—SSSSS... a Creeper popped out from behind a tree block!

The Creeper made a scary sound.
Soren jumped back.
Then—BAM!—he hit it with his sword!

POOF! The Creeper turned into smoke and gunpowder.
“No blowing up my base today!” said Soren.
He picked up the loot and kept exploring.`

        story: `Stone wanted a big, awesome base.
Not just made of wood — no way!
He used stone bricks, spruce planks, and glass panes.

First, he dug out a space on a hill.
Then he built tall stone brick walls with polished andesite floors.
He used lanterns instead of torches — so fancy!

But the coolest part?
He built a secret piston door using redstone!
“Click!” went the lever, and the door opened by itself!

Inside, Stone added a bedroom, a storage room, and even a crafting lab with anvils, enchanting tables, and item frames.

Zombies, creepers, and skeletons stayed far away.
“This base is boss,” Stone said.
And he slept safely through the Minecraft night.`

        image: 'elytra-flight.png',
        story: `Stone and Soren climbed up a mountain biome.
They both had shiny Elytra wings on their backs.
“Let’s launch from this scaffolding tower!” said Stone.

“One, two, three—WHEEEE!”
They jumped and used firework rockets to zoom!
They soared over a village, a taiga forest, and a giant ravine.

Soren did a spin. Stone flew through clouds.
“Best flight ever!” they yelled.
They flew until the sun set over the blocky world.`

        story: `Stone, Soren, and Dad found some obsidian blocks in a chest near a lava pool.
“We can build a Nether portal!” said Stone.

Soren looked curious. “How many blocks?”

“Just ten if you skip the corners,” said Stone.
He placed the blocks:
2 on the bottom, 3 up each side, and 2 across the top.

Soren helped place the last obsidian block.
Then Stone pulled out flint and steel.

FOOM! The portal lit up with purple swirls.
“Time to visit the Nether biome!” said Dad.
“Let’s hope we don’t run into a Ghast!” said Stone, grinning.`
